<p style="text-align: justify;">Iam Grandmother <u>of Auckland</u>, swear I am the plaintiff in this proceeding before Auckland Family Court. Auckland Family Court</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I'd like to update the Court on my position on my grand daughter's visit across New Zealand to have an S133 report completed once all COVID19 restrictions are lifted</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I'm not in the financial position to be able to take days off from work.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In saying that I could possibly fly over with her to a weekend night, and come back on Monday afternoon, but the expense for flights as well as the cost of a hotel room for the night would be the issue.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If I can make arrangements for this I would be more than delighted for her mother to visit and see her daughter in the place we are staying prior to flying home from New Zealand.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">My financial situation is pretty basic and, despite having everything we require but I'm not affording the luxury of having the most expensive things, like flights and hotels. The expense of legal fees in addition to all these constant expenses is a burden. The child's father has sent me money to help out and does it whenever it is possible. Other than her fathers contribution I've not received any form of assistance to help with the costs of raising a twelve year old child.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I'd also like to highlight the following scenarios, on my grand daughters twelfth birthday she had an amazing day, despite constraints due to restrictions that were that were in location. We enjoyed dinner with her father by skype at her father's request . Then we had cake and a small party or so.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After speaking with her mother she returned to the kitchen and was obviously upset. She went on to tell us the reason being that he mom had ruin her birthday by slandering her as she presented them with photos of her presents she received. This included saying that everything was second-hand (which isn't the case) the fact that it was all cheap and that it didn't have anything of significant value there. The child also mentioned that when she inquired what they had bought her (as they constantly made reference to this), they replied the money they gave her in February, when they left was her birthday present.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The mother continued to inform her that she had taken her money to buy her presents which made her feel even more upset.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">These sorts of phone calls occur on a regular basis and while most times this child can handle it and direct the conversation in an opposite direction, there have been times when she's not been able to resulting in calling her mother , and thereby blocking her from calling or having the child suffer physical illness due to the anxiety caused by the call. In one instance, she turned her camera off to ensure that no one could see her and was again in danger of being ridiculed by her mother regarding her physical appearance (a beauty spot/freckle it has on her skin).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This child also gets very angry when she hears her mother say terrible things about me. She is most upset by what they say about her other parent.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The most recent incident occurred last week, when her mother was sick and she was being badgered by her mother's grandmother who claimed that it was basically her fault for not being there and that she ought to be there to take care of her mother. Also, they were yelling at her about how she needs to inform the court that she wants to go back her home in New Zealand.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I also would like to be to be mentioned that the child lawyer has not yet contacted her since the month of November, which is the only communication she's had with her.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I've gone to my way to facilitate to locate a place she can talk to the child at a neutral location using skype or zoom. After finding a solution, I haven't heard back from her in any way.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I am of the opinion that she has felt let down because she was not able to have someone to advocate for her and voice what she needs stated.</p>
